# Rust for Beginners 🦀

Rust 101 is a useful resource for anybody who wants to start learning Rust Language. It began as a side project of Graydon Hoare, an employee at Mozilla. In short order, Mozilla saw the potential of the new language and began sponsoring it, before revealing it to the world in 2010.

From the beginning, Rust has focused on safety and performance. One of the primary ways it achieves this is by emphasizing safe concurrency. Concurrent computing allows different parts of a program to be executed out of order, opening possibility for parallel computing. This can significantly improve the performance of an application.

Today, major Blockchain networks like Solana & NEAR has adopted Rust for building dApps onto their platforms. Learning to code in this programming language can give you a significant headstart 🚀 into your Blockchain & Web3.0 career.

## Installation 🛠

The primary way to install Rust is through a tool called Rustup, which is a Rust installer and version management tool. [Click](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) on this link and it will take you to official downloads page.

In case you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux like me, use

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
In case you use Visual Studio Code editor, don't forget to install the RUST Extension from official marketplace. It's very useful 😁

## Cargo: Rust Package Manager 🦄
When you install Rustup you’ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:
```rust
1. init your project ----> "cargo new app-name"
2. build your project ---> "cargo build"
3. run your project -----> "cargo run"
4. test your project ----> "cargo test"
5. build documentation --> "cargo doc"
```

## Contributing 🌏
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

I will keep updating this repository with relevant code snippets, videos and articles to create smooth learning journey for all of you. In case you wanna collab, please DM me on Twitter [@pythontony](https://twitter.com/pythontony) 🐣
